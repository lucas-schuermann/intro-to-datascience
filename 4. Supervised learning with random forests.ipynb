    "\n",
    "In machine learning, you have a problem that needs to be solved, data related to the problem, and a computer.  In supervised learning, you're feeding data to the computer and training it to output the correct answer for a given set of inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "> For example, let's say you love eating at Jin Ramen but hate waiting for a seat.  Let's also suppose that you have a dataset of 500 visits to Jin Ramen that contains information about the wait time for a table, the time of arrival, day of week, number of people in the party, etc.  You could train a supervised learning model on this dataset to predict wait time based on the other variables.  In the future, whenever you want ramen, you can input the values you know (the \"features\") into this model to predict wait time (the \"target\"), then decide whether to visit Jin Ramen or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Supervised learning usually involves regression and classification tasks:\n",
    "- Regression: the target variable is continuous (eg. predicting the minutes you'll wait for a table)\n",
    "- Classification: the target variable is a discrete value (eg. your waiting limit is 10 mins, so you train the model to output \"0\" if the wait time will be over 10 mins, and \"1\" if the wait time will be 10 mins or under)"

    "## 2. Introduction to random forest\n",
    "\n",
    "Random forest is a machine learning technique used for classification and regression tasks.  Random forest is an \"ensemble\" method because one model is actually composed of many decision trees, each of which produces an output; these outputs are then averaged to produce the random forest model's final prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2a. What's a decision tree?\n",
    "A decision tree is a model that predicts the target value by running the inputs through a tree structure.  Decision trees can perform regression and classification tasks, so they're pretty flexible when it comes to machine learning tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "This image is a simple decision tree for predicting whether a Titanic passenger \"survived\" or \"died\" (those are the target values in this classification task):\n",
    "![decision tree](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f3/CART_tree_titanic_survivors.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2b. Lots of decision trees = Forest\n",
    "A random forest model is composed of many (you decide how many) decision trees.  The idea is that one decision tree may not be accurate, but an entire forest of independent trees will provide higher accuracy because noise is canceled out and signal is strengthened.\n",
    "\n",
    "When creating each tree, the random forest algorithm takes a sample of the data (a bootstrap sample), and produces the best possible decision tree for that sample.  When building the tree, at every node/split, a random sample of features is used.  All this sample-taking allows the forest of trees to identify data features that are truly important, not arbitrary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the entire forest is created and ready to make predictions, the random forest model runs the input down every tree, and outputs the average or majority decision of its trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Pros:\n",
    "- High accuracy\n",
    "- Fast to train\n",
    "- Can handle many input variables, which relieves you of having to choose a subset of all variables before training the model\n",
    "- Can work with numeric and categorical variables\n",
    "\n",
    "> Cons:\n",
    "- Hard to interpret\n",
    "- Prone to overfitting on noisy datasets\n",
    "- Cannot deal with features or target values that do not exist in the training data"
