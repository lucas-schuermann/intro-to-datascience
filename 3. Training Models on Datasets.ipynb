    "Let's just briefly go over what kind of model we're fitting. (We'll discuss what other kinds of modeling people usually do in the subsequent sections.) We're trying to predict a real-valued quantity, which gives the regression part of the name, and our model assumes that the output is a linear combination of the inputs, which gives the linear part of the name. For a little bit more math, we have a dataset of $N$ points, and each data point is given by $\\left(x^{(i)}_1, x^{(i)}_2, \\dots x^{(i)}_d, y^{(i)}\\right)$; in other words, each data point has $d$ features or inputs and 1 output. As we said earlier, $y^{(i)}$ is some number we're interested in predicting, so $y^{(i)} \\in \\mathbb{R}.$ The model structure then dictates that we will approximate $y^{(i)}$ in the following way: $$y^{(i)} \\approx \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x^{(i)}_1 + \\beta_2 x^{(i)}_2 + \\cdots + \\beta_d x^{(i)}_d.$$ Cool, that's the most math we'll have to do today!\n",

We'll essentially generate data assuming the model is true and add some noise; then, we'll recover the estimates of both $\\beta_0$ and $\\beta_1$, and our model should be pretty close. \n",

In the same fashion, we don't want to evaluate our model on just the data we have already seen; therefore, we usually split our data into a _testing_ and _training_ set.
